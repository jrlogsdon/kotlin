### This Kotlin project is used as an aid in my learning journey and as a reference guide for future use

The "google-free-bootcamp-class" module is following along my path with the free
"Kotlin Bootcamp for Programmers" offered at https://developer.android.com/courses/kotlin-bootcamp/overview 

As I continue to practice and learn more modules will be added, providing the structure to hopefully be able to 
quickly look at how something was implemented or done before
